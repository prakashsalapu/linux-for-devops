## 2. Structure of Linux  

### 🔹 Simple View of Linux Structure  

```plaintext
+----------------------------------------------------+
| User Applications (Vim, Docker, Apache, Chrome) |
+----------------------------------------------------+
| Shell (Bash, Zsh, Fish, etc.) |
+----------------------------------------------------+
| System Libraries (glibc, OpenSSL, etc.) |
+----------------------------------------------------+
| System Utilities (ls, grep, systemctl, etc.) |
+----------------------------------------------------+
| Linux Kernel (Process, Memory, FS, Network) |
+----------------------------------------------------+
| Hardware (CPU, RAM, Disk, Network, Devices) |
+----------------------------------------------------+
```


### (a) Hardware Layer  
- This is the **physical part of your computer**: CPU, RAM, storage, keyboard, mouse, and network card.  
- The OS talks to hardware using **device drivers** (small programs that connect hardware with software).  



### (b) Kernel – The Core of Linux  
The **Linux Kernel** is the heart of the OS. It directly controls the hardware and provides services to everything above it.  

It handles:  
- **Process Management** → Runs many programs at once (multitasking).  
- **Memory Management** → Decides how RAM is used and shared.  
- **Device Drivers** → Connects software with hardware (e.g., keyboard driver).  
- **File System Management** → Manages data storage (files, folders).  
- **Network Management** → Handles communication between computers.  

👉 Without the kernel, Linux cannot run.  



### (c) System Utilities & Libraries  
- **System Libraries** → Pre-written code that programs use to work with the kernel (e.g., `glibc`, `OpenSSL`).  
- **System Utilities** → Small programs to perform everyday tasks (`ls`, `cp`, `grep`, `systemctl`).  

👉 Together, these act as the **toolbox** for Linux.  



### (d) Shell (Command Line Interface – CLI)  
- The **Shell** is like a translator between you and the kernel.  
- You type commands → Shell passes them to the kernel → Kernel does the job.  
- Examples: **Bash, Zsh, Fish, Dash, Ksh**.  

👉 Without the shell, you cannot directly “talk” to Linux.  



### (e) User Applications  
- These are the programs you use daily:  
  - Text editors → `vim`, `nano`  
  - Web servers → `Apache`, `Nginx`  
  - DevOps tools → `Docker`, `Kubernetes`  
  - Browsers, media players, IDEs, etc.  
- Applications interact with the OS via **system calls** (through shell or GUI).  



### ✅ Summary  
Linux is structured in **layers**:  
- Hardware at the bottom.  
- Kernel in the middle (the brain).  
- Utilities, libraries, and shell on top (tools & interface).  
- User applications at the very top.  

👉 This layered design makes Linux **stable, secure, and flexible**.
