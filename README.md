# My Linux Learning Notes

A collection of my personal notes as I learn and explore Linux step-by-step. Inspired by [Abhishek Veeramalla’s Ultimate Linux Guide](https://github.com/iam-veeramalla/ultimate-linux-guide), but completely re-written in my own words, with added examples, cheat-sheets, diagrams, and practice logs.

## What's Inside
1. **Linux 101** – What is Linux, key concepts, distro differences  
2. **Setup & Tools** – Installing Linux (including via WSL), package managers (apt, dnf)  
3. **Shell & Scripting** – Bash basics, scripting snippets, environment setup  
4. **File System & Permissions** – Directory structure, `chmod`, `chown`, sticky bits  
5. **Editors & Productivity** – Vim/nano cheats, custom aliases, config tips  
6. **Processes & System Control** – `ps`, systemd, resource monitoring  
7. **Networking & Logs** – `ping`, `netstat`, journalctl, syslog navigation  
8. **Storage & Backup Strategies** – `df`, `du`, partitions, and backup scripts  
9. **Projects & Practice Logs** – My experiments, mistakes, and what clicked
